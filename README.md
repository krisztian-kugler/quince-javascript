# Quince JavaScript

Live version: https://krisztian-kugler.github.io/quince-javascript

## Technologies

* Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

## Notes

* Implemented my own solution for alphabetical list sorting (using a tweaked bubble sort technique).
* The persons list gets sorted immediately at launch. Clicking the name header swaps the sorting order.
* The app doesn't allow you to create a new person if the name is less than 3 chars.
* When a new person is created, it gets placed to its proper position in the sorted list.
* Checkboxes and checkbox logic are completely self-made, it's easier to style them this way.
* Data dump gets updated on every change (create, delete, check/uncheck employee, change sort order).

## Development and build instructions

No need for any special build tools or packages. Simply copy the project files to a web server.
