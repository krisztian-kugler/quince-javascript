## Notes

* Project is ES6-based.
* Implemented my own solution for alphabetical list sorting (using a tweaked bubble sort technique).
* The app doesn't allow you to create a new person if the name is less than 3 chars.
* Checkboxes are completely hand-made, it's easier to style them this way.

## Development and build instructions

No need for any special build tools or packages. Simply copy the project files to a web server.
